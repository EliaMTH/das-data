This set of triangulated meshes representing 3D surfaces is derived from syintetic plastic handcrafted models. One of 13 different patterns is engraved on each mesh. There are two meshes for each pattern. 

The dataset is composed by 26 different meshes and is enriched with a smoothed version of each mesh.

The triangulations are all sampled based on the number of vertexes, that is around 15000 vertexes for each mesh.

Finally, the mesh are in .off format
